# MudBot

MudBot is a proxy-like core engine accompanied by hot-reloadable modules that 
can modify the connection stream between a MUD client and MUD server.

This distribution of MudBot contains the IMapper module, which can detect
rooms, generate maps, show them in ASCII form, and auto-walk the user to
a given destination.
